# Contribution Guidelines for UOK CS 5th Batch Website

Welcome to the **UOK CS 5th Batch** website repository! ðŸŽ‰ Weâ€™re excited to have you contribute and share your personal details through the website.

Follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth contribution process.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Your Fork
Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/batch5.git
```

### 3. Add Your Folder
Go to the `pages` directory in your project, and create a folder with your name **(without spaces)**. For example, if your name is **Peter Mac**, the folder name should be `peter-mac`.

Inside this folder, create your **MDX files** (`about.mdx`, `me.mdx`, etc.) and an **_meta.js** file.

#### Folder Structure Example:

```
pages/
  Peter_Parker/
    about.mdx
    me.mdx
    _meta.js
```

#### Example of `_meta.js`:

```js
const meta = {
    me: "Peter Parker",
    about: "About Me"
}

export default meta;
```

This file will be used to manage the titles of your pages as they appear on the website.

### 4. Format Your MDX Files

Ensure that your MDX files (`about.mdx`, `me.mdx`, etc.) are properly formatted. Use the existing structure and format for consistency.

#### Example `about.mdx`:

```mdx

description: "Learn more about Peter Parker, a passionate Computer Science student."
